## helper scripts for preparing an android project (for gradle)

SO FAR WE HAVE BUILT THE DIRECTORY SHELL CORRECTLY.
WE EITHER:

1. COPY IN THE MANIFEST, MAINACTIVITY AND SOME RES WITH "COPY" OR SOMETHING
2. WRITE IN THE CONTENTS MANUALLY, OPTIONALLY WITH SUBMODULES
 
UPDATE: TRIED BOTH OF THESE AND MOSTLY WENT WITH 2. 
UPDATE(2): looks like we're doing write-only; no copying.
